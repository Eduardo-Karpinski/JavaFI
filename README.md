# OpenCV Face Recognition in Java

## Overview

This project implements facial recognition using OpenCV and Java. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces in real-time, and recognizes them using the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm. This project is a comprehensive demonstration of using computer vision techniques for real-world applications.

## Features

1. Real-time Face Detection: Captures video from a webcam and detects faces in real-time.
2. Face Recognition: Uses the LBPH algorithm to recognize faces.
3. Image Saving: Saves detected face images to specific directories based on user IDs.
4. Training: Trains the face recognition model with images stored in a specified directory.
